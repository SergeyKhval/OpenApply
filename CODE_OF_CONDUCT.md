# Code of Conduct

## The Basics

We want a productive environment for everyone. Here's how:

## Expected Behavior

- **Be professional** - Treat this like a workplace
- **Be helpful** - Share knowledge, help others when you can
- **Be constructive** - Criticism should improve things, not tear them down
- **Stay on topic** - Keep discussions relevant to the project
- **Respect people's time** - Be concise, search before asking

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks or insults
- Harassment of any kind
- Spam, trolling, or derailing discussions
- Publishing others' private information
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces - GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other project-related communication channels.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers will:
1. Remove inappropriate content
2. Ban repeat offenders
3. Report serious violations to GitHub

## Reporting

If someone is being disruptive, report it to the project maintainers via:
- GitHub issues (for public concerns)
- Email to maintainers (for private concerns)

## The Bottom Line

Act like a professional. Contribute constructively. Don't be a jerk.

This is a technical project, not a social club. Keep the focus on building good software.
